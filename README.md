# SBI Historical Forex Rates

Section 26 of the ITR advises using SBI TTBR as reference foreign exchange rates for calculating capital gains.

The rates are:

**Note:**

If you want to double check, the PDF files downloaded from SBI servers are available in the *pdf_files* folder. The reference rates to be used are on the 2nd page of the PDF.
